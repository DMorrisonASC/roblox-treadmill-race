 * *game* rather than of any one part, where a per-part attribute would be a way to make two identical
 * belts behave differently for no reason a player could perceive.
 *
 * The split matters because the two have different costs. An attribute is retunable in the Properties
 * panel but has to be derived, logged, type-checked and migrated; a constant is a rebuild but is
 * visible in a diff and impossible to half-configure. The bounce and the textures are the second
 * kind: they must look the same on every belt, so there is nothing for a per-part value to express.

 * end of the real range and only slightly above the current 0.25, so it is a small step rather than a

 * than the one it solved. A Studio run showed the size directly in the `surface created` line.
 *
 * The fix is to bound the *travel* instead of lengthening the slab. With a slab of
 * `belt.Length + LIP` studs that starts `LIP/2` behind the belt's centre and travels `LIP` studs,
 * the belt footprint is covered at every point of the pass, and the slab never extends more than
 * `LIP` beyond either end. Derivation, with belt half-length `h` and slab half-length `(L + LIP)/2`:
 * at the start of the pass the slab spans `[-h - LIP, h]`, so it covers the belt and overhangs
 * `LIP` at the back; at the end it spans `[-h, h + LIP]`, so it covers the belt and overhangs `LIP`
 * at the front. Coverage is continuous because both extremes contain `[-h, h]`.
 *
 * `LIP` is a straight trade: larger means less frequent resets (one per `LIP / BeltSpeed` seconds) and
 * more invisible lip past the belt. At 1 stud and `BeltSpeed = 10` the reset fires every 0.1 s, which
